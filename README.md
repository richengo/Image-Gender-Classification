# Image Gender Classification

### Riche Ngo

## Motivation

Facial image recognition is increasingly becoming more relevant in today's day and age. Many industries, especially within social media, have seen applications for image 
classification algorithms. Examples range from [detection of heroin smugglers from camera footage](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html) 
to [differentiation of whether someone is a dog or cat person](https://research.fb.com/blog/2016/08/cat-people-dog-people/). These systems have potential to perform complex tasks 
at a scale far beyond human capacity.

In this project, we aim to develop a facial image recognition system which could classify people into the correct genders (male/female). Use cases include verification of 
biometrics, identification of people, health tracking/analysis, etc.
